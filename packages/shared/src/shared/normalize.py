"""
Canonical normalisation routines for BatVault node payloads.

This module defines helpers to normalise incoming documents prior to
storage or external presentation.  The functions enforce a stable
shape across decision, event and transition node types.  They are
pure and operate on shallow copies of the input dictionaries.

Normalisation rules (authoritative):

* Guarantee that ``x-extra`` exists and is a dictionary.  When the
  field is missing or is not a mapping, it will be replaced with an
  empty object.
* Normalise tag values using ``core_utils.slugify_tag``:
  lowercase, ASCII-only, non-alphanumerics collapsed to single underscores,
  deduplicated with order preserved. This guarantees the same tag shape
  across ingest, Memory API, and Gateway.
* Whitelist allowed attributes per node type.  Unknown keys (for
  example ``edge`` or ``title``) are silently dropped.  Common
  transport keys such as ``snapshot_etag`` and ``meta`` are always
  preserved.
* Assign a ``type`` field when it is absent.  The provided node
  context (``event``, ``decision`` or ``transition``) is used to
  populate the field.  Downstream consumers rely on this field to
  determine the document category.
* Enforce ISO‑8601 timestamps.  When the timestamp string parses as
  a recognised datetime value it is round‑tripped into a canonical
  form: all datetimes are converted to UTC and rendered as
  ``YYYY‑MM‑DDTHH:MM:SSZ``.  When a timestamp is malformed a
  ``ValueError`` is raised.  If the value already conforms to
  ISO‑8601 with a timezone the original string is retained.

These routines are intended to be used at ingestion time prior to
inserting records into the underlying store.  They may also be
applied defensively in API layers where unnormalised objects may
appear (for example in unit tests).  However, after ingestion,
documents fetched from the store should already be normalised and
should not need further processing.
