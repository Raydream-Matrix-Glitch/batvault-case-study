    The system prompt enforces a concise style for the ``answer.short_answer``
    returned by the LLM.  Specifically:

      • The assistant must return exactly one valid JSON object matching the
        schema contained in the user's message.
      • ``answer.short_answer`` should be no more than two sentences and no
        longer than 320 characters.
      • When the decision maker and date are present in the evidence they
        should begin the short answer (e.g., "<Maker> on <YYYY-MM-DD>: ...").
      • If a "Next:" pointer is included, it should refer to the first
        succeeding transition.
      • Raw evidence IDs must never appear in the prose; cite them only in
        ``supporting_ids``.

    These instructions help the post‑processing clamp to avoid unnecessary
    fallbacks due to style violations.
